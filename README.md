## Film QUERRY Project
- This is my week 7 project and it is a program that runs a Film Query menu with a users input. This is the first program I have worked on in which I utilized data retrieved from a SQL database to construct Java objects.

## Topics
- ORM
- retrieval with JDBC
- Mapping Database data types
- Nested retrieval

## Lessons Learned
- This project incorporates Object-Relational Mapping which is code that translates entities, which are tables/rows, and attributes or columns of a database to objects and fields of an object oriented language application.
- The process of using SQL and Java OO programming was insightful and definitely helped in better understanding OOP.


## How to run
- First, the user is asked to choose an option from the menu.
- depending on which option they choose (choose film by ID #/choose film by keyword search) the user is then asked either for a keyword to search the database by, or the ID #.
- After the user gives the required information the movie info is pulled from the data base and printed to the screen.
